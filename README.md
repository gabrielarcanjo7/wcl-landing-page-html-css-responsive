# Wide Coverage Location

This project is a front-end exercise focused on CSS, aiming to practice layout, responsiveness, and component styling using only traditional CSS properties (without Flexbox or Grid).

## Features

- Responsive layout designed exclusively for mobile phones (not adapted for tablets)
- Modern fonts via Google Fonts
- Styling for header, buttons, links, and sections
- Image adjusted for different screen sizes
- CSS organized in separate files for general and responsive styles

## File Structure

```
/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── responsive.css
└── README.md
```

## How to View

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Resize the window to see the responsive behavior.
3. **Responsiveness was developed only for mobile devices** (maximum width of 425px).  
   The layout was not adapted for tablets or larger screens, so it may display distortions outside this range.
4. Main styles are in `styles.css` and mobile adjustments are in `responsive.css`.

## Notes

- The layout was created without Flexbox or Grid, using only `position`, `margin`, `width`, `inline-block`, etc.
- Colored borders may be present for debugging; remove them in the final version.
- This project can be used as a base for study or portfolio.
